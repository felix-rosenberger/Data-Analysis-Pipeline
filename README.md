# Building a Data Analytics Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
This project's goal was to leverage the power of GCP to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline. The technologies and tools used included BigQuery, Google Data Studio, and Apache Airflow. It consisted of the following steps:
1. Write multiple [SQL queries](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Analysis-Pipeline/blob/main/SQL_queries.txt) against the Google Analytics e-commerce dataset
2. Schedule the above queries in an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow by writing a [Python script](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Analysis-Pipeline/blob/main/Airflow_pipeline.py)
3. Visualise query results in a [Dashboard](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Analysis-Pipeline/blob/main/Data_Studio_Dashboard.png) using Google Data Studio
